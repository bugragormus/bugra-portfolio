        I'm Bugra Gormus, a software engineer with a background in mobile
        development, data engineering, and backend systems. I graduated from
        Kirklareli University with a B.Sc. in Software Engineering (GPA:
        3.34/4).
        <br />
        <br />
        I’ve interned at Vakifbank, developed mobile apps with Flutter under
        Google Turkey’s academy, and currently work as a data engineer at Kale
        Group—building ML pipelines, forecasting models, and data visualization
        tools using Python.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm passionate about clean code, practical problem solving, and
        continuous learning in software and data.
